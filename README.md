## Asynchronous VK "Saved Photos" Album downloader

###### About
You have a lot of great pictures that you have been saving for years? Back them up on your hard drive!

This script can be really useful for those who have a lot of pictures that need to be saved.

###### Requirements
- **Python 3.5**

- **vk Python library** - `sudo pip3 install vk` to get it

###### Usage
Run `python3 main.py` and login with your VK data. 

**Note:** Since January 2017, **Saved Pictures Album** requires permissions to be accessed to. 

The script will create a `<your_first_name>_<your_last_name>` directory and download all your saved pictures there.


If you have any ideas/issues about improving this script, I would gladly take them into account! [Issues](https://github.com/jonsnow123kappa/vk-savehouse/issues)
